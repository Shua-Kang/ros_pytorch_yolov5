# Ros_pytorch_yolov5
A ROS wrapper for [yolov5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) (v6.1 version). The [master](https://github.com/Shua-Kang/ros_pytorch_yolov5) branch is the v5.0 version.

I have tested this repo at intel cpu and single Nvidia-GPU. Since it is just a roughly merge of [yolov3_pytorch_ros](https://github.com/vvasilo/yolov3_pytorch_ros) and [yolov5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5), many useless code stays. If you have any questions, feel free to create an issue.

## Requirements
ROS Noetic(Recommanded) or Melodic 


## Running
Tracking the detection using opencv. (Rviz may be better)
